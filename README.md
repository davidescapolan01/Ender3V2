# Ender3V2
This is the repository to keep trace of the upgrade I've done to my first 3D Printer, an Ender 3 V2.
***
## Build
I recived the 3d printer on 6th October 2021 and I buld it stright away:

The build was a fast-farward build 'cause the kit was pretty easy to build.

## First build
That afternoon I've decided to print the test cube so, after the calibration of the step/mm of the extruder, and after few print used to calibrate the flow I've successfully printed the cube:

## First Firmware Update
For the firmware update I've must have messed up something with th Creality Update Firmware becuse when I tryed to load the that firmware the printer didn't fully boot and even didn't show anything in the display. afterfew reserch I've found the stoc firmware and downloaded the JyesrUI firmware form my board (4.2.2) from [this link](https://github.com/jyers/marlin/releases/).
I've picked up the manual mash one.
After the firmware changes the interface showed was something like this:

So I was able to print and to level the bed with something that moves the PrintingHed around for me, not moving it by hand as Creality suggest.
